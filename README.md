Codon Optimization Project
Overview:
This project provides a web application that optimizes mRNA sequences based on a given protein sequence. Itâ€™s designed to help researchers, scientists, and bioinformatics professionals improve the efficiency of mRNA-based therapeutics by enhancing protein expression rates through optimized codon usage.

The web app takes a protein sequence as input and generates an optimized mRNA sequence, designed to be used in experiments and studies focusing on mRNA synthesis.

Features
Protein Sequence Input: Users can input any protein sequence in single-letter amino acid codes.
mRNA Optimization: The application calculates and returns an optimized mRNA sequence.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple web form for entering sequences and receiving results.
Project Structure
app.py: The main Flask application that powers the web app.
templates/: Contains HTML templates, including index.html for the input form and result.html for displaying results.
static/: Includes static files like favicon.ico.
env/: Virtual environment for managing dependencies (not tracked in version control).
requirements.txt: Lists required Python packages, including Flask and Biopython.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.6+
Git (for version control)
Flask and Biopython libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codon_optimization_project.git
cd codon_optimization_project
Set up a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
flask run
By default, the app runs locally at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Usage
Open the app in a web browser.
Enter a protein sequence in single-letter amino acid format (e.g., MSKEGE...).
Click Optimize to receive an optimized mRNA sequence.
Example
Input: MSKEEFLTGVVPILV...
Output: AUGCUGUA... (optimized mRNA sequence)

Deployment
To deploy this app on a production server, consider using a WSGI server like Gunicorn along with Nginx. You may also deploy it to cloud services such as AWS, Heroku, or Google Cloud Platform for wider accessibility.
